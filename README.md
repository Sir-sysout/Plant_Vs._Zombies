Game Description: 

    As a classic tower defense game, the goal of the game is to survive the 
incoming zombie attacks by planting plants, the main “tower” to defeat zombies.

    A player can buy and plant plants using suns, which can be collected from
buying sunflowers

    A player loses the round, or dies, however, when a zombie gets to the house 
(assuming the lawn mower on that row is already used). 
    “The zombies ate your brain!!!”

    To win the round, a player must survive without dying. 

    Good luck on helping the adorable plants and the humans to defeat the zombies!

    P.S. The game screen is NOT resizeable.
