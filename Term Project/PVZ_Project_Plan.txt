Game Description: 

    As a classic tower defense game, the goal of the game is to survive the 
incoming zombie attacks by planting plants, the main “tower” to defeat zombies.

    A player can buy and plant plants using suns, which can be collected from
buying sunflowers

    A player loses the round, or dies, however, when a zombie gets to the house 
(assuming the lawn mower on that row is already used). 
    “The zombies ate your brain!!!”

    To win the round, a player must survive without dying. 

    Good luck on helping the adorable plants and the humans to defeat the zombies!

    P.S. The game screen is NOT resizeable.

TP2 UPDATE

###################################


What has changed:

    Now there are five different types of zombies

    Now user can click inside of the slots grid to choose a plant to plant

    Fixed some bugs when bullet hit zombies 

    For now, to fire a bullet from a plant, a player needs to click on it


Algotithmic Plan:

    To make projectile a way for a plant to attack zombies 

        - I'm working on it

    To make a DFS/Dijkstra algorithm for the "smart zombie" (yellow ones)
so that these zombies can find the shortest distance to the other side of the lawn

        - Also working on it

        I have written some codes for the basic part of these two algorithms 


    AFTER MVP:
        add in the sprite sheets for each plant
